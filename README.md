# tic-tac-toe
A fun game of Tic Tac Toe.

The game allows two players to play against each other, or for a player to play against the AI. For the JavaScript portion of the project, I applied some of the JavaScript design patterns, such as factory functions and modules, to organize the logic of the game.

This project was created for the Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe.
